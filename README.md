My Personal Website
This project is a personal portfolio and data visualization website developed for Assignment 2. It features a professional resume-style landing page and a dedicated portfolio page showcasing custom SVG visualizations and generative art.
Technologies Used

    HTML5 & CSS3: Structured with semantic HTML and styled using Flexbox for a cohesive, responsive layout.

    Google Fonts: Integrated the Roboto font family for a modern, minimalist look.

    JavaScript (ES6+): Used for both DOM-based interactivity and the generation of dynamic SVG elements.

    SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics): Employed for precise, high-quality data representation and digital art.

Website Structure

    index.html: The homepage containing a personal introduction, education, skills, and contact information.

    visualizations.html: A portfolio page hosting two distinct visual works.

    style.css: A unified stylesheet that manages the "black and white" aesthetic across the entire site.

    main.js: Handles interactivity, mainly a hover-glow effect on the homepage.

    vis.js: The logic engine for drawing and generating the SVG visualizations.

Featured Visualizations

    Album Delay Timeline: A 1D visualization mapping the release delays of Kanye West's Bully. It uses solid red markers for past missed dates and a hollow marker for the projected future release date in March 2026.

    Generative 'Glitch' Art: A creative piece generated via a JavaScript loop that creates 100 random lines with varying opacities to mimic digital noise and static.
